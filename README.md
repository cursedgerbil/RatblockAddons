**Sorry, RBA is abandoned, I haven't played Skyblock in forever.**

Some updates from a frustrated SBA user who wanted the plugin to be further modernised. (No, this is not a rat. It's a joke about my name. :>)

This fork of SBA is open-source so feel free to check out the code if you wish.
It is up to date with the latest release of SBA (as of 19 Aug 2022).

Although I have branded it differently to avoid confusion, this mod's ID and mod data are identical to SkyblockAddons. This means your settings from SBA will carry over to RatblockAddons, and vice versa. It also means any mods you might be using that require SkyblockAddons will also work with RatblockAddons (though some may be incompatible).

This mod is kept more up to date than SBA as I have lots of time to dedicate to it's development.
Please check out the releases section to download the mod.

Thank you to Biscuit and all SBA contributors for creating the original SBA and giving clear instructions on how to easily fork and clone the project.
